unit tests:

all the data relevant to unit tests is located in the folder "tests"
all unit tests are executed by running all_tezts.py.
single unit tests can also be executed just as any other method.

finilize_tezt:

Some unit tests are finalized by the method finilize_tezt. The concept of finilizing the unit tests this way is explained in details in the projekt seminar report ***LINK***. If for any reason the ideal output of the method has changed, the unit test of that method needs to be executed with "set_accepted_values" of finilize_tezt set to 1. This way the accepted value is updated. After updating the accepted value, set "set_accepted_values" back to 0.

mock_system :

some unit tests require the communication with the instruments. Since the instruments are mostly not available in the test phase, the mock_system simulats the behaviour of the instruments. In fact, some unit tests will only pass on the mock_system, but not on the real instruments, since the mock_system always behaves exactly the same, which is not true when measuring on the real system. 
The mock_system can be turned on by setting use_mock_system to 1 in the settings.py.
